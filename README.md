# Janggi

This program is a python implementaion of the board game Janggi, otherwise known as Korean chess. The game engine, which originally utilized a commandline based interface, was built as a portfolio project for CS162 at Oregon State University. I then chose to build out a graphic user interface in order to provide an easier way for users to interact with the project. 

## Rules

While the rules may vary, I chose to have the blue player start first.
