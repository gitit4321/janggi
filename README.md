# Janggi

This program is a python implementaion of the board game Janggi, otherwise known as Korean chess. The game engine, which originally utilized a command line based interface, was built as a portfolio project for CS162 at Oregon State University. I then chose to build out a graphic user interface in order to provide an easier way for users to interact with the project. 

## Rules
The pieces are octagonal in shape, vary in size, are placed on the intersections of lines, and are arranged symmetrically. Each side of the board has a nine-point fortress, marked by an “X” of diagonal lines. The General (or King) begins in the center of the fortress. 

The two sides (Red and Blue) alternate, moving one piece in each turn, in an attempt to force the capture of the enemy General (King), just as in other forms of chess. When a General is left with no option but to be captured in the next move, they are in checkmate, and have lost the game.

All pieces capture by landing on a point occupied by an enemy piece, using their normal movement (discussed below) to arrive at that location. The enemy piece is removed from play for the rest of the game.
